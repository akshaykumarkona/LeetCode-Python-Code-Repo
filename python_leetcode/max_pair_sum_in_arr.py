# ## Question:

# You are given an integer array nums. You have to find the maximum sum of a pair of numbers from nums such that the largest digit in both numbers is equal.

# For example, 2373 is made up of three distinct digits: 2, 3, and 7, where 7 is the largest among them.

# Return the maximum sum or -1 if no such pair exists.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [112,131,411]

# Output: -1

# Explanation:

# Each numbers largest digit in order is [2,3,4].

# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [2536,1613,3366,162]

# Output: 5902

# Explanation:

# All the numbers have 6 as their largest digit, so the answer is 2536 + 3366 = 5902.

# Example 3:

# Input: nums = [51,71,17,24,42]

# Output: 88

# Explanation:

# Each number's largest digit in order is [5,7,7,4,4].

# So we have only two possible pairs, 71 + 17 = 88 and 24 + 42 = 66.



# Code:

class Solution:
    def maxSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        best_for_digit = {}  # max_digit â†’ largest number seen
        max_sum = -1

        for num in nums:
            max_digit = max(str(num))
            if max_digit in best_for_digit:
                # Possible pair sum
                max_sum = max(max_sum, best_for_digit[max_digit] + num)
                # Update the largest number for this digit if needed
                best_for_digit[max_digit] = max(best_for_digit[max_digit], num)
            else:
                best_for_digit[max_digit] = num

        return max_sum
